## Description

As a developer who hates to take the time to write individual readme files for every project, I wanted a way to easily generate consistently high quality README files in a short amount of time.
Simply put, it solves the problem of having to write out READMEs.
Through this project I got to practice string interpolation and dip my toe into nodejs. I also learned a lot about README files themselves in the process.
